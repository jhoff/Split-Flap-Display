# SplitFlap PCB

This project contains a PCB design (made in KiCad) for the SplitFlap
display.  The PCB is designed to support a single display and to connect
to the ESP32 or the next board using JST connectors.

Note that the PCB design is still in development and was designed by
someone without any prior experience in PCB design.  Any improvements or
feedback is welcome.
